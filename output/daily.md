## [The Mechanics of Multiphase Magmas: A Perspective from the Scale of Crystals and Bubbles to Magma Reservoirs](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-124419?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>The interplay between melt, crystals, andvolatile bubbles controls the physical properties of magmas in Earth's crust, the rate of phase separation, and, by extension, chemical differentiation. The mechanical processes that couple crystals, bubbles, and melt are nonlinear, and their expression in magmatic systems can vary greatly with the relative phase proportions in the magma. In this review we propose a multiscale perspective on multiphase magmas under crustal storage conditions, with a specific focus on phase separation mechanisms. We start with an inventory of forces acting on a single crystal or volatile bubble in a silicate melt. We follow with a discussion of different upscaling strategies to simplify the description of the dynamics at greater scales, relevant to the evolution of magma reservoirs.We discuss recent progress in the development of models to study the internal dynamics of magma reservoirs, highlight current challenges, and propose possible paths for further progress.</p> <p> <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The mechanical interaction between the constituents (melt, crystals, and bubbles) at the scale of crystals controls the properties of magmas. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The choice of upscaling strategy is controlled by the processes that are considered. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Melt-crystal separation processes and their efficiency vary with the relative proportion of the phases involved. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Melt extraction by repacking is fast compared to compaction but stalls as the mush reaches the maximum packing. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [A Practical Guide to Phylogenetic Paleoecology](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-011040?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>The burgeoning field of phylogenetic paleoecology combines paleoecological data with hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships to tease apart the roles that ecology and relatedness both play in the evolution and function of an organism. The purpose of this review is to make phylogenetic paleontology more accessible to a wider array of scientists and attract new researchers to the discipline. Herein, we use recently published analyses of a diverse array of fossil animals (e.g., arthropods, echinoderms, and carnivorans) to better illustrate the breadth of research questions that can be studied using phylogenetic paleoecology. Phylogenetic paleoecology has been used to discern drivers of morphological change and variations in evolutionary rates, along with the relationship between phylogeny, biogeography, and ecology. Additional avenues of research could focus on modularity and mosaicism in evolution, as well as the impact of mass extinctions and adaptive radiations. By encouraging a greater diversity of scientific backgrounds and plurality of thought, and by incorporating new perspectives from different areas of both geology and biology, the field of phylogenetic paleoecology will lead to the consideration of new questions, avenues, and possibilities that would otherwise go unexplored.</p></div>

## [Science and Society's Views of the Anthropocene](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-010346?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Stratigraphers&#8217; recent vote to reject the Anthropocene as a geological epoch could have consequences beyond geology, as many other disciplines have adopted the term. This review focuses on the potential effects of this negative vote on the humanities and social sciences by drawing on perspectives from science and society. It argues that stratigraphers&#8217; negative vote is likely to have little effect on other disciplines because most humanists and social scientists are not using the stratigraphic term. Instead, they understand the Anthropocene as shorthand for human-caused environmental change, which is clearly occurring. Humanists and social scientists also remain interested in the Anthropocene because the collapsing distinction between the human and the geological continues to present challenges worth engaging with. While the diverse interpretations and engagements with the Anthropocene may result in incoherence, this review summarizes literature that suggests that this plurality of meanings is what gives the Anthropocene concept its strength.The Anthropocene is likely to remain a key concept in the humanities and social sciences, despite stratigraphers&#8217; rejection of the epoch. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The Anthropocene means different things to different disciplines.

## [Petrological Constraints on the Thermal History of Magma Storage in the Crust](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-113641?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Understanding the links between magmatic evolution and volcanic eruptions requires knowledge of the physical behavior of magmas stored and transported within Earth's crust. The mobility of magmas is fundamentally tied to their rheology and therefore the temperatures they experience during residence&#8212;their thermal history. We review petrological and other constraints on magma thermal histories that silicic magmas experience during crustal storage. We also focus on the recent debate between cold and warm magma storage models, using a common conceptual framework that allows a more coherent synthesis of magma storage conditions. Evidence suggests that although most silicic crustal magmatic systems spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, variations exist in space and time. The recognition of dominantly immobile but variable storage conditions allows us to move beyond a simple dichotomy and to ask more interesting questions about how these variations in magma storage occur and evolve. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Understanding the thermal conditions of crustal magma storage is critical to assessing magma mobility and the ability to erupt. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>We synthesize available information about thermal histories that magmas experience within a common conceptual framework. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Most silicic magmas spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, but variability exists over time and space within and between magma systems. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>We can advance our understanding most effectively by focusing on the controls on these variations and implications for magma evolution and eruption. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Molten Salts: Fluid Inclusion Record and Role in Forming Mineral Deposits](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-023602?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Fluid inclusions provide a wealth of information on the compositions, temperatures, and other properties of fluids that form mineral deposits. Fluid inclusions representative of aqueous-hydrothermal ore-forming fluids have been studied extensively over many years, and our understanding of their properties is comprehensive. But in recent years, evidence has been mounting for widespread occurrence of novel and unexpected types of fluid inclusions. These fluids are composed of molten alkali-calcic chloride, sulfate, and carbonate components, and they contain little to no H<span class="jp-sub">2</span>O. Their physical and chemical properties are only starting to be explored, but evidence for their capacity to mobilize certain metals, and their participation in crustal ore-forming processes, is growing. The objectives of this review are to showcase these novel solutions and to discuss their origins and roles in forming mineral deposits. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Fluid inclusions in minerals reveal widespread occurrence of natural molten salts. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Evidence for molten salts, composed of chloride, sulfate, and carbonate components, is reported in numerous ore deposits. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Molten salts are low-viscosity fluids, highly chemically reactive, and capable of transporting high concentrations of critical metals. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Molten salts represent a novel and unexpected type of crustal ore-forming fluid. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Volcanoes, Climate, and Society](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-013254?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>This review examines the societal ramifications of large volcanic eruptions&#8212;not the proximal impacts of lava, ash, pumice, and gaseous emissions but rather the consequences of the climate forcing triggered by dispersal of volcanic sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere. Using ice core records of volcanism and tree-ring data of summer temperature anomalies, we analyze 38 preindustrial eruptions that injected an estimated 6 Tg or more of sulfur into the stratosphere. We then explore more than 100 works that consider the volcanism-climate-society nexus, teasing out the key elements of their arguments for or against the role of volcanically forced climate change in far-field societal impacts. As well as summarizing and interrogating the history of ideas and state of the art on this topic, we hope to stimulate further holistic, interdisciplinary approaches to assess the broader implications of volcanic eruptions, particularly for global food security&#8212;both in the past and in the future. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>There are compelling arguments to consider the role of volcanically forced climate change in explanations of history. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Such research requires integration of geographical, ecological, demographic, econometric, and other data with historical sources and narratives, and therefore demands cross-disciplinary conversation. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Statistical evidence is needed to attribute weather and climate extremes to volcanic forcing, and agricultural and pastoral responses to climate anomalies must be reconstructed at high spatiotemporal resolution. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Several prominent climate forcing eruptions in circa 304, 1182, 1345, and 1453 CE have hitherto received comparatively little attention. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Geology: The Once and Future Crown Jewel of Science?](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-041023-094929?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>As a field geologist, I have been involved in the overwhelming excitement of three scientific revolutions&#8212;a mini revolution in structural geology, the impact-extinction revolution that freed geology from uncompromising uniformitarianism, and the plate tectonic revolution that turned the routine field of geology into one of the most exciting and essential sciences of the present time. I have also worked across several discipline boundaries, an activity I call scientific trespassing. My career has unfolded in such unexpected ways that, like anyone's life and like the history of our planet, it can only be seen as a most improbable journey. A focus on these three concepts and on the history of geology (a traditional name used here for all the Earth sciences) leads to the understanding that geology was once the crown jewel of sciences, and that after a century of necessary but routine geologic mapping, geology now needs to resume its crown jewel role because the understanding and care of our planet is becoming humanity's most urgent task.</p></div>

## [A Scientist in Russia: My Story](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032924-011101?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Born on December 12, 1937, I remember the first bombing of Moscow by the Germans in 1941. My schooling began in 1944, and I soon became interested in chemistry, setting up a kind of makeshift chemical laboratory behind a high cupboard in my house. I enrolled in Moscow University in 1955 and published my first scientific paper in 1959. After entering graduate school in 1960, I produced dense silica with a rutile structure, a natural analog of which was later named stishovite. I received my doctorate in 1961 and got a job at the Institute of Crystallography in 1962, where I worked until 1993. My first visit to the West was in 1976. I was became a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at Caltech in 1989&#8211;1990 and a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1990. I was a Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley and an Orson Anderson Distinguished Scholar at Los Alamos National Laboratory. From 1993 to 2022, I was director of the Institute for High Pressure Physics. During that time, I was awarded the P. Bridgman Gold Medal and the Gold Medal of P. Kapitsa.</p></div>

## [Experimental Thermochemistry Through the Years with Application to Chalcogenides](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-041023-094742?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Chalcogenides (sulfides, selenides, tellurides, arsenides, antimonides) are important in natural processes, including formation of ore deposits on Earth, early stages of planetary accretion, and formation of condensates in planetary atmospheres. Their physicochemical properties render them suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. While thermodynamic data are available for many endmembers, there are significant gaps in both thermodynamic and associated structural constraints, especially for complex systems. The continuous evolution of high temperature calorimetry into oxidative drop solution calorimetry has facilitated the measurement of enthalpies of formation and mixing and surface energies involving nonoxides, including chalcogenides. These are essential for modeling processes in nature and technology and for understanding the underlying properties that define their stabilities. This article reviews the development of these calorimetric techniques and summarizes available thermochemical data for common chalcogenides. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Over the last century, calorimetric instruments and techniques have evolved to enable accurate measurement of a wide range of materials, including chalcogenides. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Despite the growing interest in the thermodynamic characterization of chalcogenides, a systematic review of the available data indicates that there is still a significant scope for further research. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>A systematic understanding of chalcogenides will facilitate the modeling of geological environments and enable the prediction and improvement of geo-inspired materials for industrial applications. </li> </ul></p></div>

Solid-state viscosity of the media is responsible for establishing the time history of a shock wave. In 2003, researcher H. Jay Melosh recognized the need for an understanding of solid viscosity spanning the petrologic and lithologic scales, and accordingly, he undertook the assessment and analysis of available nuclear ground shock measurements. This review furthers Melosh's epic efforts. In pursuing both the nuclear ground shock data and supporting laboratory test data, it undertakes methods for determining and calculations of the viscosity of solid materials on the respective scales. Further, applicability of viscoelasticity in modeling the shock response on the scales of concern is demonstrated and applied. The review closes with a discussion of universal features of the shock wave viscous time history in solid materials. Solid viscosity as an adiabatic invariant is presented, and commonalties of the solid shock wave with the nonlinear dynamics of ocean waves are noted. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>This article reviews Melosh's analysis of nuclear ground shock measurements with application to shock wave structuring viscosity. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>It discusses viscoelastic calculations with application to wave structure of nuclear ground shocks and laboratory shock waves in brittle granular solids, and universal features of the viscous shock wave structure and invariance of the dissipative action are considered. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>It also discusses wave action invariance in both the nonlinear dynamics of ocean waves and the steady wave structure of shock waves in solid matter. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Minna de Honkoku: Citizen-Participation Transcription Project for Japanese Historical Documents](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-120834?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Minna de Honkoku began as an online citizen science project to transcribe earthquake-related historical materials from the Earthquake Research Institute Library of the University of Tokyo. In Japan, almost all the documents are written in kuzushiji (old-style Japanese cursive script), a writing style used before &#8764;1900. Because the style of writing is different from modern Japanese, transcription is necessary to use the historical documents as data for earthquake research. The workspace of Minna de Honkoku consists of a viewer of a document image and a vertical (Japanese-style) editor for transcription. Users can input transcribed text while viewing its image. The ranking of characters transcribed is displayed to keep users motivated. As of October&#160;2024, more than 9,700 people were registered for the project, with the total number of characters transcribed at about 41 million. The text generated by Minna de Honkoku can be used for various academic research fields including seismology and can be used to enhance citizens&#8217; disaster awareness. The paired kuzushiji characters and text data generated by Minna de Honkoku are beginning to be used as training data for artificial intelligence. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Minna de Honkoku is an online citizen science project aimed at deciphering historical documents. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The total number of participants is 9,700, and characters transcribed by Minna de Honkoku reaches 41 million. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Minna de Honkoku began as a project to transcribe earthquake-related historical materials. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The text generated by Minna de Honkoku is used in seismology and various research fields and for building artificial intelligence&#8211;based kuzushiji recognition. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Metal Isotopes in Mammalian Tissues](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-024549?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Ecologists rely on a wealth of data, including field observations and light stable isotopes, to infer dietary preferences and other ecological and physiological properties in living mammals. But inferring such important traits (e.g., trophic position, metabolism, pathologies) in extinct animals, including humans, can be challenging because biological processes rarely mirror morphology as preserved in the fossil record. For instance, dietary behavior does not necessarily reflect tooth morphology. As an additional challenge, some isotopic mammal tissues commonly used in modern ecology, such as collagen in bone or dentine or keratin from hair, hoof, or horn, do not generally preserve in fossil remains older than &#8764;200 kyr. In contrast, major constituents of bioapatite often retain their initial isotopic composition through fossilization processes. Recent analytical developments in mass spectrometry now allow, using small samples, for assessment of isotopic variability of major and trace elements such as calcium or zinc. Here, we review the application potentials of metal (nontraditional isotopes) for (paleo)ecological, (paleo)physiological, and (paleo)mobility inferences as applied to mammalian research. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Mammals are key elements of modern ecosystems and possess a rich evolutionary history, yet inferences about their past ecologies and physiologies are challenging to retrieve using traditional geochemical toolkits. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Metal stable isotopes provide a novel and complementary approach to unveil paleoecological and paleophysiological characteristics of extinct mammal species. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Within a 20-year time frame, the core of metal isotopic data in mammalian research remains small compared to traditional isotopic systems (C, O, N), which is inviting for designing cost-effective instrumentation and increasing dissemination across scientific disciplines. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Critical Minerals](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-023316?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Critical minerals are essential for sustaining the supply chain necessary for the transition to a carbon-free energy source for society. Copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements are particularly in demand for batteries and high-performance magnets used in low-carbon technologies. Copper, predominantly sourced from porphyry deposits, is critical for electricity generation, storage, and distribution. Nickel, which comes from laterite and magmatic sulfide deposits, and cobalt, often a by-product of nickel or copper mining, are core components of batteries that power electric vehicles. Lithium, sourced from pegmatite deposits and continental brines, is another key battery component. Rare earth elements, primarily obtained from carbonatite- and regolith-hosted ion-adsorption deposits, have unique magnetic properties that are key for motor efficiency. Future demand for these elements is expected to increase significantly over the next decades, potentially outpacing expected mine production. Therefore, to ensure a successful energy transition, efforts must prioritize addressing substantial challenges in the supply of critical minerals, particularly the delays in exploring and mining new resources to meet growing demands. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The energy transition relies on green technologies needing a secure, sustainable supply of critical minerals sourced from ore deposits worldwide. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements are geologically restricted in occurrence, posing challenges for extraction and availability. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Future demand is expected to surge in the next decades, requiring unprecedented production rates to make the green energy transition viable. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Coccoliths as Recorders of Paleoceanography and Paleoclimate over the Past 66 Million Years](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040623-103211?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Coccolithophores are a major group of oceanic calcifying phytoplankton, and their calcite skeletal remains, termed calcareous nannofossils, are a major component of deep-sea sediments accumulating since the Jurassic. Cocco-lithophores play a role in both the biological pump and the carbonate pump, exporting organic and inorganic carbon, respectively, out of the surface ocean. This means that they are key responders to and recorders of ocean carbon cycle and climate changes over geological and shorter timescales, and studying these responses can help elucidate the uncertain fate of calcifying phytoplankton under projected climate change scenarios. Here, we review established and emerging approaches for reconstructing (<span class="jp-italic">a</span>) mixed-layer ocean temperature, (<span class="jp-italic">b</span>) marine productivity, and (<span class="jp-italic">c</span>) aspects of the ocean carbon cycle, using calcareous nannofossils from deep-sea sediments.

## [Isotope Evolution of the Depleted Mantle](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-031621-112052?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>The depleted mantle reservoir is that part of Earth's mantle from which crust has been extracted, leaving the remaining mantle depleted in incompatible elements. Knowing how and when it formed is essential for understanding the chemical evolution of Earth, including formation of continental crust. The best-constrained Hf isotope data presented here indicate that the mantle does not become significantly depleted until as late as 700 million years after Earth's accretion. This onset of mantle depletion coincides with the first appearance of substantial volumes of continental crust in the geological record. These data compel a revision to the reference depleted mantle parameters used in Hf isotope studies of planetary evolution. This new reference line follows chondritic evolution until 3.8 Ga and then describes a linear trajectory to a present-day depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt source mantle composition (&#949;<span class="jp-sub">Hf</span> = +18). We infer that stabilization of continental crust only occurred in earnest on Earth after 3.8 Ga. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Hf isotopes show that Earth's mantle does not become significantly depleted until 700 million years after planetary accretion. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Most of Earth's oldest rocks formed from mantle sources that had radiogenic isotope compositions similar to those of chondritic meteorites. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Isotope evidence shows that Hadean (&gt;4.0-billion-year-old) crust was not essential for formation of younger crust in Archean terranes. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Growth of Earth's continents only began in earnest after 3.8 Ga. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Diving Deeper: Leveraging the Chondrichthyan Fossil Record to Investigate Environmental, Ecological, and Biological Change](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-010455?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>The extensive chondrichthyan fossil record spans 400+ million years and has a global distribution. Paleontological studies provide a foundation of description and taxonomy to support deeper forays into ecology and evolution considering geographic, morphologic, and functional changes through time with nonanalog species and climate states. Although chondrichthyan teeth are most studied, analyses of dermal denticle metrics and soft tissue imprints are increasing. Recent methodological advances in morphology and geochemistry are elucidating fine-scale details, whereas large datasets and ecological modeling are broadening taxonomic, temporal, and geographic perspectives. The combination of ecological metrics and modeling with environmental reconstruction and climate simulations is opening new horizons to explore form and function, demographic dynamics, and food web structure in ancient marine ecosystems. Ultimately, the traits and taxa that endured or perished during the many catastrophic upheaval events in Earth's history contribute to conservation paleobiology, which is a much-needed perspective for extant chondrichthyans. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The longevity and abundance of the chondrichthyan fossil record elucidates facets of ecological, evolutionary, and environmental histories. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Though lacking postcranial, mineralized skeletons, dental enameloid and dermal denticles exquisitely preserve morphology and geochemistry. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Technical advances in imaging, geochemistry, and modeling clarify the linkages between form and function with respect to physiology, diet, and environment. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Conservation efforts can benefit from the temporal and spatial perspective of chondrichthyan persistence through past global change events. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Reconstructing Tropical Cyclone Activity from Sedimentary Archives](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-021619?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>The brevity of the instrumental record limits our knowledge of tropical cyclone activity on multidecadal to longer timescales and hampers our ability to diagnose climatic controls. Sedimentary archives containing event beds provide essential data on tropical cyclone activity over centuries and millennia. This review highlights the advantages and limitations of this approach and how these reconstructions have illuminated patterns of tropical cyclone activity and potential climate drivers over the last millennium. Key elements to developing high-quality reconstructions include confident attribution of event beds to tropical cyclones, assessing the potential role of other mechanisms, and evaluating the potential influence of geomorphic changes, sea-level variations, and sediment supply on a settings&#8217; susceptibility to event bed deposition. Millennium-long histories of severe tropical cyclone occurrence are now available from many locations in the western North Atlantic and western North Pacific, revealing clear regional shifts in activity likely related to intervals of large-scale ocean-atmosphere reorganization. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Prior to significant human influence in Earth's climate, natural climate variability dramatically altered patterns of tropical cyclone activity. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>For some regions (e.g., The Bahamas and the Marshall Islands), earlier intervals of tropical cyclone activity exceeded what humans have experienced during the recent period of instrumental measurements (&#8764;1850 CE&#8211;present). </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Risk assessments based on the short instrumental record likely underestimate the threat posed by tropical cyclones in many regions. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation associated with the Little Ice Age (&#8764;1400&#8211;1800 CE) resulted in significant regional changes in tropical cyclone activity. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Given the past sensitivity of tropical cyclone activity to climate change, we should anticipate regional shifts in tropical cyclone activity in response to ongoing anthropogenic warming of the planet. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [The Once and Future Gas: Methane's Multifunctional Roles in Earth's Evolution and Potential as a Biosignature](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-124821?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Methane (CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span>) is a simple molecule that, due to its radiative forcing, wields an outsized impact on planetary heat balance. Methane is formed by diverse abiotic pathways across a range of pressures and temperatures. Biological methanogenesis for anaerobic respiration uses a terminal nickel-containing enzyme and is limited to the archaeal domain of life. Methane can also be produced in aerobic microbes during bacterial methylphosphonate and methylamine degradation and via nonenzymatic reactions during oxidative stress. Abiotic CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> is produced via thermogenic reactions and during serpentinization reactions in the presence of metal catalysts. Reconstructions of CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> cycling over geologic time are largely inferential. Throughout Earth's history, CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> has probably been the second most important climate-forcing greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Biological methanogenesis has likely dominated CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> flux to Earth's atmosphere for the past &#8764;3.5 billion years, during which time CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> is thought to have generally declined as atmospheric oxygen has risen. Here we review the evolution of the CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> cycle over Earth's history, showcasing the multifunctional roles CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> has played in Earth's climate, prebiotic chemistry, and microbial metabolisms. We also discuss the future of Earth's atmospheric CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span>, the cycling of CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> on other planetary bodies in the Solar System (with special emphasis on Titan), and the potential of CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> as a biosignature on Earth-like extrasolar planets. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Before life arose on Earth, abundant atmospheric CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> in Earth's early atmosphere was likely key for establishment of habitable conditions and production of organic molecules for prebiotic chemistry. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Biological methanogenesis for anaerobic respiration is only known to exist in some groups of anaerobic archaea, but CH<span class="jp-sub">4</span> can also be produced via enzymatic and nonenzymatic biological pathways that are not directly coupled to energy conservation.

## [Puzzles in Planetary Dynamos: Implications for Planetary Interiors](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-111523-081635?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Intrinsic magnetic fields were once commonplace across our Solar System, and many planetary bodies have sustained active dynamos to the present day. The nature and behavior of these dynamos vary widely, however, reflecting the diverse internal conditions of planets as summarized in this review. For the terrestrial planets, the existence of active dynamos and/or ancient remanent magnetization recorded in crustal rocks, or lack thereof, lead to questions about their timing and power sources. Paleomagnetic studies reveal that many small bodies in the Solar System exhibit remanent magnetization, often attributed to ancient core dynamos with little known about the fluid dynamics. For the gas giants, their dipole-dominated magnetic fields and internal structures are relatively well-characterized, with dilute cores that are not centrally concentrated and other stable layers that likely affect the dynamo in ways that are not yet understood. For the ice giants, their multipolar magnetic fields and internal structures are unusual yet poorly constrained, to the extent that even the water-to-rock ratio is not well-known. Through adoption of a broader comparative planetology approach, the study of dynamos in exoplanets and cool stars enriches our understanding of dynamo theories. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Planetary dynamos exhibit diverse magnetic fields shaped by their distinct physical and chemical conditions. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The study of planets and stars connects planetary science, geophysics, and astrophysics, revealing shared dynamo processes. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>While significant progress has been made in understanding planetary and stellar magnetic fields, many puzzles still persist. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [The Role of Microorganisms in Shaping Earth's Magnetic History](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-024053?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>Geomagnetic methods allow us to explore the behavior of Earth's geodynamo, constrain Earth's composition and structure, and locate critical minerals and other resources essential for modern technologies and the energy transition. The magnetic properties of rocks and sediments are assumed to be stable and largely attributable to inorganic processes. This conventional view overlooks mounting evidence of microorganisms as key players in rock transformations and geological processes. Iron-bearing minerals are ubiquitous in most environments and are commonly used by microorganisms as electron donors and acceptors. Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties by creating, altering, and dissolving Fe-bearing minerals, potentially modifying the original magnetization, complicating interpretations of the magnetic record. This review provides an overview of biogenic pathways that modulate magnetic minerals and discusses common, yet underutilized, magnetic methods for capturing such behavior. Appreciating the influence of microbial activities on magnetic properties will improve our interpretations of Earth's geologic past and its elemental cycling. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties, challenging traditional views of a geologically stable magnetic record formed solely by inorganic processes. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Microbial iron cycling modulates magnetic properties modifying magnetic information recorded in rocks. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Microbial processes may have impacted Earth's magnetic history more deeply than previously understood. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Recognizing microbial contributions is critical for accurate interpretation of paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic records and could aid in the search for life on other planetary bodies. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [A Holistic View of Climate Sensitivity](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-014302?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>The notion of climate sensitivity has become synonymous with equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), or the equilibrium response of the Earth system to a doubling of CO<span class="jp-sub">2</span>. But there is a hierarchy of measures of climate sensitivity, which can be arranged in order of increasing complexity and societal relevance and which mirror the historical development of climate modeling. Elements of this hierarchy include the well-known ECS and transient climate response and the lesser-known transient climate response to cumulative emissions and zero emissions commitment. This article describes this hierarchy of climate sensitivities and associated modeling approaches. Key concepts reviewed along the way include climate forcing and feedback, ocean heat uptake, and the airborne fraction of cumulative emissions. We employ simplified theoretical models throughout to encapsulate well-understood aspects of these quantities and to highlight gaps in our understanding and areas for future progress. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>There is a hierarchy of measures of climate sensitivity, which exhibit a range of complexity and societal relevance. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Equilibrium climate sensitivity is only one of these measures, and our understanding of it may have reached a plateau. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The more complex measures introduce new quantities, such as ocean heat uptake coefficient and airborne fraction, which deserve increased attention. </li> </ul></p></div>

<div><p>Field experiences are highly valued in geoscience education. However, logistical, financial, and accessibility challenges associated with fieldwork and rapid advancements in technology have all prompted geoscience educators to explore virtual field experiences (VFEs) as alternatives. Rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of VFEs has not kept pace with their implementation, but recent studies offer meaningful and actionable findings that can inform ongoing and future use of VFEs in geoscience education. We present a review of selected studies that address three significant aspects of this still-evolving modality. First, we examine current characterization and classification of VFEs. Second, we examine studies that evaluate the effectiveness of teaching with VFEs. Third, we extend this review to studies that compare VFEs with in-person field experiences (IPFEs). The studies we review demonstrate that VFEs are a valuable approach to teaching introductory geoscience content, even compared to IPFEs. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Challenges associated with field geoscience education and improvements in technology have led geoscience educators to develop and implement virtual field experiences (VFEs) as teaching tools. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>VFEs are tested, practical, and effective alternatives to in-person field experiences in introductory geoscience education. </li> </ul></p></div>

## [Subaerial Emergence of Continents on Archean Earth](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040722-093345?TRACK=RSS)

<div><p>The emergence of continental crust above sea level influences Earth's surface environments and climate patterns, and it creates diverse habitats that promote biodiversity. Earth exhibits bimodal hypsometry with elevated continents and a submerged seafloor. However, it remains elusive when and how this unique feature was first established. The geological record suggests the presence of subaerial landmasses between ca.&#160;3.8 and 2.4&#160;billion years ago (Ga), but their spatial extent and longevity remain unclear. Further, the tectonic processes governing the proportion of continental land to ocean basins and topography during this period are poorly understood. Here, we synthesize a variety of geological and geochemical proxies to suggest that crustal emergence did occur in the early-to-mid Archean, primarily exposing precratonized volcanic crust for brief time periods. Stable continental crust on a regional scale (as cratons) began emerging around ca.&#160;3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga, facilitated by the development of thick, stable cratonic lithospheres. Over hundreds of millions of years, voluminous magmatism within a plateau-type setting led to the formation of thick, felsic crust and depleted mantle keels, allowing cratons to rise above sea level via isostatic adjustment. The areal extent of emergent land increased from ca.&#160;3.0 to 2.5&#160;Ga owing to the formation of more cratons, likely coinciding with the onset of plate tectonics, and culminated around ca.&#160;2.5&#8211;2.2&#160;Ga when land surface area and freeboard conditions resembled those observed today. These newly emerged landmasses possibly played a critical role in oxygenating the atmosphere and oceans, cooling the climate, and promoting biodiversity during the late Archean to early Paleoproterozoic. <ul> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Continental emergence marks a pivotal moment in Earth's history, impacting the planet's atmosphere, oceans, climate, and life evolution. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>We review the rock record to infer the timing, nature, and tectonic drivers of continental emergence on early Earth. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Emergence on early Archean Earth was mostly transient, exposing primarily volcanic crust. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>The first stable continental land formed at ca. 3.2&#8211;3.0 Ga due to the development of thick cratons and their isostatic adjustment. </li> <li><span class="label">&#9642;&#160; </span>Emergent land area increased from ca. 3.0 to 2.5 Ga as more felsic crust formed and plate tectonics began. </li> </ul></p></div>
