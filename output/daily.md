### [The Mechanics of Multiphase Magmas: A Perspective from the Scale of Crystals and Bubbles to Magma Reservoirs](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-124419?TRACK=RSS)
The interplay between melt, crystals, andvolatile bubbles controls the physical properties of magmas in Earth's crust, the rate of phase separation, and, by extension, chemical differentiation. The mechanical processes that couple crystals, bubbles, and melt are nonlinear, and their expression in magmatic systems can vary greatly with the relative phase proportions in the magma. In this review we propose a multiscale perspective on multiphase magmas under crustal storage conditions, with a specific focus on phase separation mechanisms. We start with an inventory of forces acting on a single crystal or volatile bubble in a silicate melt. We follow with a discussion of different upscaling strategies to simplify the description of the dynamics at greater scales, relevant to the evolution of magma reservoirs.We discuss recent progress in the development of models to study the internal dynamics of magma reservoirs, highlight current challenges, and propose possible paths for further progress.

* ▪ 
  The mechanical interaction between the constituents (melt, crystals, and bubbles) at the scale of crystals controls the properties of magmas.
* ▪ 
  The choice of upscaling strategy is controlled by the processes that are considered.
* ▪ 
  Melt-crystal separation processes and their efficiency vary with the relative proportion of the phases involved.
* ▪ 
  Melt extraction by repacking is fast compared to compaction but stalls as the mush reaches the maximum packing.

### [A Practical Guide to Phylogenetic Paleoecology](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-011040?TRACK=RSS)
The burgeoning field of phylogenetic paleoecology combines paleoecological data with hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships to tease apart the roles that ecology and relatedness both play in the evolution and function of an organism. The purpose of this review is to make phylogenetic paleontology more accessible to a wider array of scientists and attract new researchers to the discipline. Herein, we use recently published analyses of a diverse array of fossil animals (e.g., arthropods, echinoderms, and carnivorans) to better illustrate the breadth of research questions that can be studied using phylogenetic paleoecology. Phylogenetic paleoecology has been used to discern drivers of morphological change and variations in evolutionary rates, along with the relationship between phylogeny, biogeography, and ecology. Additional avenues of research could focus on modularity and mosaicism in evolution, as well as the impact of mass extinctions and adaptive radiations. By encouraging a greater diversity of scientific backgrounds and plurality of thought, and by incorporating new perspectives from different areas of both geology and biology, the field of phylogenetic paleoecology will lead to the consideration of new questions, avenues, and possibilities that would otherwise go unexplored.

### [Science and Society's Views of the Anthropocene](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-010346?TRACK=RSS)
Stratigraphers’ recent vote to reject the Anthropocene as a geological epoch could have consequences beyond geology, as many other disciplines have adopted the term. This review focuses on the potential effects of this negative vote on the humanities and social sciences by drawing on perspectives from science and society. It argues that stratigraphers’ negative vote is likely to have little effect on other disciplines because most humanists and social scientists are not using the stratigraphic term. Instead, they understand the Anthropocene as shorthand for human-caused environmental change, which is clearly occurring. Humanists and social scientists also remain interested in the Anthropocene because the collapsing distinction between the human and the geological continues to present challenges worth engaging with. While the diverse interpretations and engagements with the Anthropocene may result in incoherence, this review summarizes literature that suggests that this plurality of meanings is what gives the Anthropocene concept its strength.The Anthropocene is likely to remain a key concept in the humanities and social sciences, despite stratigraphers’ rejection of the epoch.

* ▪ 
  The Anthropocene means different things to different disciplines. These multiple meanings are likely to persist.
* ▪ 
  A plurality of meanings and usages of the Anthropocene captures how knowledge is produced and may spur environmental solutions.

### [Petrological Constraints on the Thermal History of Magma Storage in the Crust](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-113641?TRACK=RSS)
Understanding the links between magmatic evolution and volcanic eruptions requires knowledge of the physical behavior of magmas stored and transported within Earth's crust. The mobility of magmas is fundamentally tied to their rheology and therefore the temperatures they experience during residence—their thermal history. We review petrological and other constraints on magma thermal histories that silicic magmas experience during crustal storage. We also focus on the recent debate between cold and warm magma storage models, using a common conceptual framework that allows a more coherent synthesis of magma storage conditions. Evidence suggests that although most silicic crustal magmatic systems spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, variations exist in space and time. The recognition of dominantly immobile but variable storage conditions allows us to move beyond a simple dichotomy and to ask more interesting questions about how these variations in magma storage occur and evolve.

* ▪ 
  Understanding the thermal conditions of crustal magma storage is critical to assessing magma mobility and the ability to erupt.
* ▪ 
  We synthesize available information about thermal histories that magmas experience within a common conceptual framework.
* ▪ 
  Most silicic magmas spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, but variability exists over time and space within and between magma systems.
* ▪ 
  We can advance our understanding most effectively by focusing on the controls on these variations and implications for magma evolution and eruption.

### [Molten Salts: Fluid Inclusion Record and Role in Forming Mineral Deposits](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-040523-023602?TRACK=RSS)
Fluid inclusions provide a wealth of information on the compositions, temperatures, and other properties of fluids that form mineral deposits. Fluid inclusions representative of aqueous-hydrothermal ore-forming fluids have been studied extensively over many years, and our understanding of their properties is comprehensive. But in recent years, evidence has been mounting for widespread occurrence of novel and unexpected types of fluid inclusions. These fluids are composed of molten alkali-calcic chloride, sulfate, and carbonate components, and they contain little to no H2O. Their physical and chemical properties are only starting to be explored, but evidence for their capacity to mobilize certain metals, and their participation in crustal ore-forming processes, is growing. The objectives of this review are to showcase these novel solutions and to discuss their origins and roles in forming mineral deposits.

* ▪ 
  Fluid inclusions in minerals reveal widespread occurrence of natural molten salts.
* ▪ 
  Evidence for molten salts, composed of chloride, sulfate, and carbonate components, is reported in numerous ore deposits.
* ▪ 
  Molten salts are low-viscosity fluids, highly chemically reactive, and capable of transporting high concentrations of critical metals.
* ▪ 
  Molten salts represent a novel and unexpected type of crustal ore-forming fluid.

### [Volcanoes, Climate, and Society](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032524-013254?TRACK=RSS)
This review examines the societal ramifications of large volcanic eruptions—not the proximal impacts of lava, ash, pumice, and gaseous emissions but rather the consequences of the climate forcing triggered by dispersal of volcanic sulfate aerosol in the stratosphere. Using ice core records of volcanism and tree-ring data of summer temperature anomalies, we analyze 38 preindustrial eruptions that injected an estimated 6 Tg or more of sulfur into the stratosphere. We then explore more than 100 works that consider the volcanism-climate-society nexus, teasing out the key elements of their arguments for or against the role of volcanically forced climate change in far-field societal impacts. As well as summarizing and interrogating the history of ideas and state of the art on this topic, we hope to stimulate further holistic, interdisciplinary approaches to assess the broader implications of volcanic eruptions, particularly for global food security—both in the past and in the future.

* ▪ 
  There are compelling arguments to consider the role of volcanically forced climate change in explanations of history.
* ▪ 
  Such research requires integration of geographical, ecological, demographic, econometric, and other data with historical sources and narratives, and therefore demands cross-disciplinary conversation.
* ▪ 
  Statistical evidence is needed to attribute weather and climate extremes to volcanic forcing, and agricultural and pastoral responses to climate anomalies must be reconstructed at high spatiotemporal resolution.
* ▪ 
  Several prominent climate forcing eruptions in circa 304, 1182, 1345, and 1453 CE have hitherto received comparatively little attention.

### [Geology: The Once and Future Crown Jewel of Science?](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-041023-094929?TRACK=RSS)
As a field geologist, I have been involved in the overwhelming excitement of three scientific revolutions—a mini revolution in structural geology, the impact-extinction revolution that freed geology from uncompromising uniformitarianism, and the plate tectonic revolution that turned the routine field of geology into one of the most exciting and essential sciences of the present time. I have also worked across several discipline boundaries, an activity I call scientific trespassing. My career has unfolded in such unexpected ways that, like anyone's life and like the history of our planet, it can only be seen as a most improbable journey. A focus on these three concepts and on the history of geology (a traditional name used here for all the Earth sciences) leads to the understanding that geology was once the crown jewel of sciences, and that after a century of necessary but routine geologic mapping, geology now needs to resume its crown jewel role because the understanding and care of our planet is becoming humanity's most urgent task.

### [A Scientist in Russia: My Story](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-032924-011101?TRACK=RSS)
Born on December 12, 1937, I remember the first bombing of Moscow by the Germans in 1941. My schooling began in 1944, and I soon became interested in chemistry, setting up a kind of makeshift chemical laboratory behind a high cupboard in my house. I enrolled in Moscow University in 1955 and published my first scientific paper in 1959. After entering graduate school in 1960, I produced dense silica with a rutile structure, a natural analog of which was later named stishovite. I received my doctorate in 1961 and got a job at the Institute of Crystallography in 1962, where I worked until 1993. My first visit to the West was in 1976. I was became a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at Caltech in 1989–1990 and a member of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1990. I was a Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley and an Orson Anderson Distinguished Scholar at Los Alamos National Laboratory. From 1993 to 2022, I was director of the Institute for High Pressure Physics. During that time, I was awarded the P. Bridgman Gold Medal and the Gold Medal of P. Kapitsa.

### [Experimental Thermochemistry Through the Years with Application to Chalcogenides](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-041023-094742?TRACK=RSS)
Chalcogenides (sulfides, selenides, tellurides, arsenides, antimonides) are important in natural processes, including formation of ore deposits on Earth, early stages of planetary accretion, and formation of condensates in planetary atmospheres. Their physicochemical properties render them suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. While thermodynamic data are available for many endmembers, there are significant gaps in both thermodynamic and associated structural constraints, especially for complex systems. The continuous evolution of high temperature calorimetry into oxidative drop solution calorimetry has facilitated the measurement of enthalpies of formation and mixing and surface energies involving nonoxides, including chalcogenides. These are essential for modeling processes in nature and technology and for understanding the underlying properties that define their stabilities. This article reviews the development of these calorimetric techniques and summarizes available thermochemical data for common chalcogenides.

* ▪ 
  Over the last century, calorimetric instruments and techniques have evolved to enable accurate measurement of a wide range of materials, including chalcogenides.
* ▪ 
  Despite the growing interest in the thermodynamic characterization of chalcogenides, a systematic review of the available data indicates that there is still a significant scope for further research.
* ▪ 
  A systematic understanding of chalcogenides will facilitate the modeling of geological environments and enable the prediction and improvement of geo-inspired materials for industrial applications.
